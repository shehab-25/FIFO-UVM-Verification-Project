# FIFO UVM-Based Verification

## Project Overview
This project involves the design and verification of a synchronous FIFO (First-In, First-Out) buffer, widely used in digital systems for data transfer between components operating at different clock rates or execution speeds. The design incorporates control signals like full, almost full, empty, and almost empty flags to manage data flow efficiently. Verification, conducted using Universal Verification Methodology (UVM), tested the FIFO's functionality under various conditions.

## FIFO design parameters
**FIFO_WIDTH**: DATA in/out and memory word width (default: 16).

**FIFO_DEPTH**: Memory depth (default: 8).

     | wr_en       | Input       | Write Enable: If the FIFO is not full, asserting this signal causes data (on data_in) to be written into the FIFO                              |
     | rd_en       | Input       | Read Enable: If the FIFO is not empty, asserting this signal causes data (on data_out) to be read from the FIFO                                |
     | clk         | Input       | Clock signal                                                                                                                                   |

     | full        | Output      | Full Flag: When asserted, this combinational output signal indicates that the FIFO is full. Write requests are ignored when the FIFO is full.  |
     | almostfull  | Output      | Almost Full: When asserted, this combinational output signal indicates that only one more write can be performed before the FIFO is full.      |
     | empty       | Output      | Empty Flag: When asserted, this combinational output signal indicates that the FIFO is empty. Read requests are ignored when the FIFO is empty.|
     | almostempty | Output      | Almost Empty: When asserted, this output combinational signal indicates that only one more read can be performed before the FIFO goes to empty.|
     | overflow    | Output      | Overflow: This sequential output signal indicates that a write request (wr_en) was rejected because the FIFO is full.                          |
     | underflow   | Output      | Underflow: This sequential output signal Indicates that the read request (rd_en) was rejected because the FIFO is empty.                       |
     | wr_ack      | Output      | Write Acknowledge: This sequential output signal indicates that a write request (wr_en) has succeeded.                                         |
     | data_out    | Output      | Read Data: The sequential output data bus used when reading from the FIFO.                                                                     |
